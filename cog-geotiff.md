A normal GeoTIFF and a Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) share the same basic file structure for storing geospatial raster data, but they differ in organization and optimization for certain use cases, especially when it comes to access patterns and performance in cloud environments. Here’s an overview of each and the main differences between them:

### Normal GeoTIFF

A standard GeoTIFF is a raster file format that stores geospatial data along with metadata in a tagged format, allowing software to interpret spatial properties (like coordinates, projections, and transformations) alongside the pixel data. These files are versatile and commonly used across GIS software for local and desktop applications.

Key points:
- **Internal Structure**: A GeoTIFF stores image data in continuous blocks. Pixel data can be compressed or uncompressed but typically requires reading the entire file or large portions to access specific areas.
- **Access Patterns**: Not optimized for partial data access. When hosted in the cloud, fetching small sections can be slow since it might require downloading large file sections.
- **Metadata**: Stores spatial metadata such as coordinate reference system (CRS), pixel scale, and bounding box.

### Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)

A Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF is an adaptation of the GeoTIFF format designed for efficient access and streaming directly from cloud storage without requiring a full file download. COGs achieve this through specific internal file structures that optimize partial access.

Key optimizations:
- **Tiling**: COGs are organized into internal, smaller tiles, allowing access to individual tiles independently. This means clients can fetch only the tiles needed for specific operations, which is ideal for large datasets and cloud-hosted environments.
- **Overviews**: COGs contain multiple resolution levels (overviews) within the file, so lower-resolution data can be accessed without reading the full-resolution data. This is efficient for applications that don’t require maximum detail (e.g., thumbnails or previews).
- **Byte Range Requests**: By structuring data in tiles and including overviews, COGs allow for byte-range requests. This enables applications to fetch just the required bytes from a file stored in a cloud object storage system (e.g., AWS S3).
- **Compatibility**: COGs are still valid GeoTIFFs, so most software that supports GeoTIFFs can read COGs. However, not all software can leverage the COG optimizations, especially those without cloud access features.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature                   | Normal GeoTIFF                         | Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Data Organization**     | Continuous data blocks                | Tiled for partial access               |
| **Cloud Storage Efficiency** | Not optimized; requires larger data transfer | Optimized with byte-range requests      |
| **Overviews**             | Optional, often separate              | Included in-file for multi-resolution access |
| **Performance in Cloud**  | Slower, high transfer cost            | Faster, cost-efficient for cloud access|
| **Compatibility**         | Supported across GIS platforms        | Fully compatible, with additional benefits in cloud environments |

In essence, COG is a GeoTIFF formatted for efficient and scalable cloud usage, while a normal GeoTIFF is optimized for traditional, local access.
