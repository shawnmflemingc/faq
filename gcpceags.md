# Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine with AGS

The trailing . at the end of the Connection-specific DNS Suffix causes issues where the certificate won't be generated by ArcGIS Server on install. Navigating to %Install%\ArcGIS\Server\framework\etc\certificates you will find only a keystorepass.dat file in this condition

## Solution 1

Change the Windows HOSTS to have the FQDN resolve without the . at the end. 

## Solution 2

Create a hostname.properties file in `%Install%\ArcGIS\Server\framework\etc` and put a single line `hostname=interface.domain.com`

## Steps to have the certificates recreated

1. Stop ArcGIS Server service
2. Rename the folder `%Install%\ArcGIS\Server\framework\etc\certificates`
3. Start ArcGIS Server and the files will be generated.

To determine if the fix is working the certificates folder will contain files arcgis.keystore, SelfSignedCertificate.cer and the keystorepass.dat together.
