# Lesson: How to Take Screenshots in Windows 10 (Windows 11 is below)

Taking screenshots is a valuable skill for documenting steps when you're learning something new or troubleshooting a problem. Here's a simple guide on how to do it first using Windows 10, then below shown for Windows 11.

## 1. **Using the Print Screen Key (PrtScn)**
   - **Full Screen Screenshot:**
     - Press the `PrtScn` key on your keyboard. This captures the entire screen and copies it to the clipboard.
     - To save the screenshot, open an application like Paint, Word, or an email, and press `Ctrl + V` to paste the image. You can then save or share it.
   
   - **Screenshot of the Active Window:**
     - Press `Alt + PrtScn`. This captures only the currently active window and copies it to the clipboard.
     - Paste the image into an application using `Ctrl + V` to save or share.

## 2. **Using the Snipping Tool**
   - **Opening Snipping Tool:**
     - Search for "Snipping Tool" in the Windows search bar and open the app.
   - **Capturing a Screenshot:**
     - Click on "New" in the Snipping Tool. You can select different types of snips:
       - *Free-form Snip:* Draw a free-form shape around the area you want to capture.
       - *Rectangular Snip:* Drag the cursor to create a rectangle around the area you want to capture.
       - *Window Snip:* Capture a specific window.
       - *Full-screen Snip:* Capture the entire screen.
   - **Saving the Screenshot:**
     - After capturing, click on the disk icon to save the screenshot. Choose a location and file name, and click "Save."

## 3. **Using Windows + Shift + S (Snip & Sketch)**
   - **Capturing a Screenshot:**
     - Press `Windows + Shift + S`. The screen will dim, and a small toolbar will appear at the top.
     - Choose the type of screenshot you want to take:
       - *Rectangular Snip:* Drag to capture a rectangular area.
       - *Freeform Snip:* Draw a freeform shape to capture.
       - *Window Snip:* Click on the window you want to capture.
       - *Full-screen Snip:* Capture the entire screen.
   - **Saving the Screenshot:**
     - The screenshot will be copied to your clipboard. You’ll see a notification; click on it to open the Snip & Sketch app, where you can edit or save the image.

## 4. **Using the Windows + PrtScn Shortcut**
   - **Capturing and Saving Automatically:**
     - Press `Windows + PrtScn`. This captures the entire screen and automatically saves it as a file.
     - The screenshot will be saved in the "Screenshots" folder within the "Pictures" library. The file will be named "Screenshot (#).png," where # is the number of the screenshot.

## 5. **Tips for Effective Documentation**
   - **Annotate Your Screenshots:**
     - Use the Snip & Sketch tool to add annotations like arrows, text, or highlights to your screenshots for clarity.
   - **Save Screenshots in Order:**
     - Name your screenshots sequentially (e.g., Step 1, Step 2) to maintain order when documenting a process.
   - **Share Screenshots Easily:**
     - Screenshots can be easily attached to emails, documents, or shared directly in chats to help others follow your steps.

# Windows 11 Changes to Screen Shots

Windows 11 introduces some changes and enhancements for taking screenshots, though many of the methods from Windows 10 remain the same. Here’s what changes in Windows 11:

## 1. **Windows 11 Snipping Tool (Enhanced)**
   - **Unified Snipping Tool:**

## 2. **New Windows 11 Keyboard Shortcut:**
   - **Windows + PrtScn:**
     - Just like in Windows 10, pressing `Windows + PrtScn` still captures the entire screen and automatically saves it to the "Screenshots" folder in your "Pictures" library.
     - **Direct Access to Snipping Tool:**
       - Pressing `Windows + Shift + S` now directly launches the snipping toolbar, letting you choose your desired snip type immediately without first launching a separate app.

## 3. **Snip & Sketch (Part of Snipping Tool in Windows 11)**
   - **Replaced by Snipping Tool:**
     - The Snip & Sketch app is no longer a separate app in Windows 11. Its functionality is fully integrated into the new Snipping Tool.

## 7. **Auto-Saving Screenshots:**
   - **Snipping Tool Behavior:**
     - When you take a snip, the image will still be copied to your clipboard by default, but you can choose to automatically save the snip to a location of your choice by selecting "Save As" after capturing.
